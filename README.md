# StarMatch-Game
 
A game designed in JavaScript and React where you choose numbers that add up to the number of stars on the left. Completed during the [React: Getting Started](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/react-js-getting-started/table-of-contents) module on Pluralsight.

Copied from the JSComplete Playground and saved into a React app in order to be able to save the code outside of the dev playground. Built using functional component structure.

I also played around in this one with actually breaking the React components out into their own files, as the tutorial and the dev playground was designed to have everything as one massive file. Dunno if this is considered best practice in terms of structure, but it's what I went with.

The final provided version of the code (not broken into pieces) is saved in the top level file just as a record.

## Known Bugs
You can cheat the timer by rapidly clicking the number over and over. Still need to fix.
